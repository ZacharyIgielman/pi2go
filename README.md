pi2go
=====
These are the scripts I have made for using and testing with the pi2go.
One of them simply reads the sonar module and outputs the distance to the closest object in the direction that it is pointing
The other follows a black line, you may have to switch one/both of the way round you plugged in the motors for it to work
